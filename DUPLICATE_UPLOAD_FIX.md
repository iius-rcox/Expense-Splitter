# Duplicate Upload Fix - Idempotent Behavior

## Problem
Users were getting `409 Conflict` errors when uploading the same PDF twice, which blocked their workflow and required manual intervention.

## Solution Implemented
Changed upload endpoints to **idempotent behavior** - uploading the same PDF twice now returns the existing record with `200 OK` instead of throwing an error.

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/api/routes/upload.py`

**Both endpoints modified:**
- `POST /api/upload/car`
- `POST /api/upload/receipt`

**Before:**
```python
if duplicate_pdf:
    # ... cleanup ...
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_409_CONFLICT,
        detail=create_error_response(...)
    )
```

**After:**
```python
if duplicate_pdf:
    # ... cleanup ...
    logger.info(f"Duplicate PDF detected, returning existing record | ...")

    # Return existing PDF record (idempotent behavior)
    return PDFUploadResponse(
        pdf_id=duplicate_pdf.id,
        filename=duplicate_pdf.filename,
        pdf_type=duplicate_pdf.pdf_type,
        page_count=duplicate_pdf.page_count,
        file_size_bytes=duplicate_pdf.file_size_bytes,
        uploaded_at=duplicate_pdf.uploaded_at
    )
```

## Behavior Changes

### Before
- ❌ Upload same PDF → `409 Conflict` error
- ❌ User workflow blocked
- ❌ Required manual intervention

### After
- ✅ Upload same PDF → `200 OK` with existing PDF data
- ✅ Idempotent (safe to retry)
- ✅ No workflow interruption
- ✅ File deduplication still works (duplicate physical file is deleted)

## Testing

**Test Case:** Upload the same CAR PDF twice

**Expected Result:**
1. First upload: `201 Created` - new PDF record
2. Second upload: `200 OK` - returns existing PDF record

**Response (both uploads):**
```json
{
  "pdf_id": "5e19aad2-e4ce-4ab4-b74e-23acd50dde00",
  "filename": "Cardholder+Activity+Report+General-S-89S,DD2LJ,DFRHA (6).pdf",
  "pdf_type": "car",
  "page_count": 178,
  "file_size_bytes": 555203,
  "uploaded_at": "2025-10-18T..."
}
```

## Benefits

1. **User-Friendly**: No errors for duplicate uploads
2. **API-Friendly**: Idempotent operations are RESTful best practice
3. **Retry-Safe**: Works with automatic retry patterns
4. **Storage-Efficient**: Duplicate files still deleted, saves disk space
5. **Zero-Config**: No frontend changes required

## Notes

- SHA-256 hash-based deduplication still active
- Duplicate physical files are automatically cleaned up
- Database maintains single record per unique file
- Works for both CAR and receipt PDFs
